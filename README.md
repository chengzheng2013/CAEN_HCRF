High Resolution SAR image classification

Here, we will publish the data sets used in our paper submissions, and we will gradually organize and update these files. Stay tuned.

Our main research direction is high-resolution SAR image classification, and the main existing problems are:
1) High-resolution SAR image datasets and their corresponding label data are rarely disclosed;
2) Feature extraction method of high-resolution SAR images;

As a start, we hope to contribute to the development of the high-resolution SAR image community by creating publicly available high-resolution SAR datasets with labeled data and even high-resolution SAR databases with multiple images.

Here, we will disclose the data sets and some code used in the papers we submit, which will be gradually organized and and updated. 
Please wait. 
Meanwhile, I hope more people can come together to discuss and solve the classification problem of high-resolution SAR images.
Thank you!
